                <p class="textBox"id="about">&emsp;&emsp; I am an 18 year old Software Developer living in Columbus, Ohio. I specialize in Web Devleopent with React.js, but often times use standard HTML/CSS/JS since I could not use React.js in my classes. I specialize in almost anything JavaScript, but I also feel comfortable working with Python and C#. I have slight experience with Java and mySql, but have never used them for any projects. </p>

                <p class="textBox" id="life" >What do I do in my free time you might ask, well the answer is not much, but it used to be different. I'm a former <a href="https://youtu.be/fKjOwCS2_wQ" target="_blank">Rubik's Cube competitor</a> (sorry for the terrible taste in music) as well as an outfielder for the Westerville Wolves Baseball team (we were the worst team in the entire league). I also played Varisty Valorant for the Delaware Area Career Center Esports team for the 2022 Spring Season. I have the opportunity to go back and coach the Valorant Team in their Fall season as well.

                    The thing is I dont do any of those anymore, Im just a guy who loves video games, I'm currently trying to get 100% achievements on a game called <a href="https://everhoodgame.com" target="_blank"> Everhood</a>
                    I have also spent lots of time playing games like CS:GO, Valornat, Minecraft, osu!, and many more games.
                <br><br>
                    I also occasionally stream on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/matt_4g" target="_blank">Twitch</a> and post videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGThkZg1WIPDWBLKt2bq1uA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, but thats more of a fun thing than something I am pursuing
